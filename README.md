# OnlaReminder
The reminder program that reminds you of something. It has its language ORS and helps you to make breaks between your work

! currently is under deep development and is not ready for use!

# How to install?
*here gonna be text about the installation process*

# What is the ORS-Language?
This is a small scenario language to save scenarios in files. You can write it on its own!

The documentation is provided in __saves/example.ors__ file

# The idea
The idea came to my head when I realized that I spend too much time sitting in front of a computer with no breaks.

So I made the prototype of OnlaReminder and then thought that I could make it better, add GUI, and make it easier to create scenarios for others!

# What is a Scenario?
The scenario is the thing that is contained in the ORS file and reminds you about breaks and other important stuff in time

# TODO
1. ORS Language
2. Visual ORS-files creator
3. The time-TODO(you add 6 or more things you need to do in some time and іуе to each thing time for which it is necessary to fulfill)
4. (maybe) port for Android
