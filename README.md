# OnlaReminder
The reminder program that reminds you of something. It has its language ORS and helps you to make breaks between your work

! currently is under deep development and is not ready for use!

# How to install?
simply go to the __link to realeses__ download zip file, unpack it wherever you want, and then just run the jar file

# What is the ORS-Language?
This is a small scenario language to save scenarios in files. You can write it on its own!

The documentation is provided in __saves/example.ors__ file

# The idea
The idea came to my head when I realized I spend too much time sitting in front of a computer without breaks.

So I made the prototype of OnlaReminder. I thought that I could make it better, add GUI, and make it easier to create scenarios for others!

# What is a Scenario?
The scenario is the thing that is contained in the ORS file and reminds you about breaks and other important stuff in time

# TODO
1. just the timer (you set the time then the timer is running)
2. Visual ORS-files creator
3. The time-TODO(you add six or more things you need to do in some time and set to each thing time for which it is necessary to fulfill)
4. add $TIME and $DATE commands
5. (maybe) port for Android
